# Poor Richard's Almanack by Benjamin Franklin
The poor have little, beggars none, the rich too much, enough not one.

He that lies down with Dogs, shall rise up with fleas.

Men and melons are hard to know.

Take this remark from Richard poor and lame. Whate'er's begun in anger ends in sham.

No man e'er was glorious, who was not laborious.

All things are easy to Industry.

All things are difficult to sloth

Would you persuade, speak of Interest, not Reason.

Teach your child to hold his tongue, he'll learn fast enough to speak.
